This project deploys a web application infrastructure on Microsoft Azure using Terraform. The infrastructure includes a load balancer, virtual machines with IIS installed, SQL Server and database, network security group, virtual network with subnets, public IP addresses, and a storage account.

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the deployment of a scalable and resilient web application infrastructure on Azure using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles with Terraform. By automating the infrastructure deployment, we ensure consistency, reliability, and repeatability across environments.
